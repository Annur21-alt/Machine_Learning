# Write a python function that takes 2 parameters lower and upper (range). Let the function returns pairs of amicable numbers in that range.
# Two different numbers are called amicable numbers if the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. For example 220 and 284 are amicable numbers.
# For example if we call that function: amicableNumbers(1, 1000)
# The function must return: [220, 284]
# Why they are amicable numbers ?
# Sum of proper divisors of 220 = 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110 = 284
# Sum of proper divisors of 284 = 1+2+4+71+142 = 220

print ("This program will takes 2 parameters lower and upper(range)")
